# GoldenHaven.Helper — Terms of Service

Effective date: 2025-10-25

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the GoldenHaven.Helper Discord bot and related services (the "Bot" or the "Service") provided by m17132557-png ("we", "us", or "Owner"). By installing, inviting, accessing, or using the Bot you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

1. Definitions
- "Bot" or "Service": GoldenHaven.Helper, including its commands, features, integrations, and any web interfaces, dashboards, APIs, or hosting used to run the Bot.
- "User", "you", "your": any person or entity that uses the Bot, whether directly or via a Discord server.
- "Content": messages, files, commands, data, or other materials submitted by Users or generated by the Bot.
- "Server": a Discord server (guild) on which the Bot is invited or used.

2. Eligibility
- You must be at least 13 years old (or older if required by local law) to use the Bot.
- You must comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Use of the Bot does not exempt you from those terms.

3. Acceptance and Changes
- By using the Bot you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.
- We may update these Terms at any time. Changes take effect when posted. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will strive to notify server owners/admins of major changes.

4. License to Use the Bot
- Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Bot for its intended purposes.
- You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of the Bot software or code without our written permission.

5. User Content and Conduct
- You are solely responsible for Content you create, upload, post, transmit, or otherwise make available via the Bot.
- You must not use the Bot to engage in illegal activity or to facilitate activity that violates Discord terms or local laws, including but not limited to:
  - Harassment, threats, hate speech, or targeted abuse.
  - Doxxing or sharing private/personal information without consent.
  - Distribution of malware, phishing, or other malicious content.
  - Copyright piracy or distributing unauthorized copyrighted works.
  - Any activity that would expose us to civil or criminal liability.
- Do not attempt to bypass rate limits, scraping protections, API restrictions, or access controls that the Bot or related services have in place.
- Abusive or excessive command usage that degrades the Service, or other users' experience, may be limited or blocked.

6. Moderation, Enforcement, and Account Access
- We reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary to protect the Bot, Service infrastructure, other users, or our legal interests. Actions include removing content, disabling features for specific users or Servers, or suspending or terminating access.
- We are not obligated to retain copies of any Content. You should maintain your own backups if needed.

7. Privacy and Data
- We collect and process certain data to provide, maintain, and improve the Bot (e.g., Discord user IDs, server IDs, messages, command usage logs, and basic analytics). The specifics are described in our Privacy Policy [link or location].
- The Bot may use third-party services (e.g., hosting providers, analytics, or uptime services). Data may be shared with those providers as necessary to run the Service.
- We will not sell your personal data. We may share data if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or the Service.

8. Intellectual Property
- All intellectual property rights in the Bot (including code, branding, and documentation) are owned by the Owner or licensors.
- You retain ownership of Content you submit, subject to the license you grant below.
- By submitting Content to the Bot you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, transmit, reproduce, modify (for technical purposes), and display that Content as reasonably necessary to provide the Service.

9. Third-Party Services and Integrations
- The Bot may integrate with third-party services (e.g., APIs, payment processors). Your use of those services is also subject to the applicable third-party terms. We are not responsible for the practices or availability of any third-party services.

10. Paid Features, Billing, and Refunds (if applicable)
- If the Bot offers paid or premium features, separate payment terms will apply. All fees are non-refundable except where required by law or as stated in the payment terms. We reserve the right to change pricing or remove features; we will provide notice when feasible.

11. Disclaimers
- THE BOT AND THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE.
- We do not guarantee uptime, accuracy of Content produced by the Bot, or that the Bot will meet your requirements.

12. Limitation of Liability
- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOT OR THESE TERMS.
- OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES WILL NOT EXCEED $100 USD (or the equivalent amount you paid for the Service in the prior 12 months, if any). This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

13. Indemnification
- You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Owner, its affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Bot, your Content, or your breach of these Terms.

14. DMCA and Copyright
- If you believe your copyrighted work has been used in a way that constitutes infringement, contact our designated agent at the contact information below with a complete DMCA takedown notice. We will respond promptly and may remove infringing Content as required by law.

15. Termination
- We may suspend or terminate your access to the Bot at any time for breach of these Terms or for any other reason. Upon termination, any licenses granted to you will end and you must cease using the Service.

16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
- These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Owner resides or operates (unless otherwise required by applicable local law). Any dispute will be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

17. Severability
- If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will remain in effect.

18. Contact
- Owner: m17132557-png
- GitHub: https://github.com/m17132557-png
- Contact email: (please replace with your preferred contact address) support@goldenhaven.helper or your real administrative email.

19. Additional Provisions for Server Owners / Administrators
- Server owners and administrators are responsible for configuring the Bot's permissions and for ensuring the Bot's behavior complies with community rules and laws.
- If the Bot offers moderation or automated actions, owners/admins should test and review those actions—automatic moderation is not a substitute for active moderation by server staff.

20. Feedback
- If you provide suggestions, improvements, or feedback about the Bot, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and incorporate that feedback into the Service.
